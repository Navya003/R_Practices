# R Programming Files

This repository contains a collection of R scripts that I've created, including:
- **Classroom Exercises**: Solutions to assignments and exercises from my R programming courses.
- **Practice Projects**: Basic R scripts for learning and practicing core concepts.
  
These files may be helpful for anyone learning R, but please note that they are not intended to be production-ready or comprehensive tutorials.
